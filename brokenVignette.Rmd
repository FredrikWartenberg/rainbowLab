RainbowLab is a tool to simulate the mechanisms behind the formation
of rainbows. The approach to this based on tracing rays of light
through a drop of water and recording the differences between incident
and exiting angle.
The tool allows to 3D render the traced rays as well as evaluating the
angular differences by means of a number of graphs.
In its standard usage the parameters to be varied are the order of
rainbows, the number of colors traced and the angular
resolution/granulatriy of the the incident rays.

## Elementary Usage

### Before you start

#### Installing (only needed once)

`install.packages(path_to_file, repos = NULL)`

#### loading the library (needed after each new start of R environment

`library(rainbowLab)`

### 3d Visualisation of rays through a drop of water

`traceOneRay()`

### Rainbow PDF distributions

`generateRainbows()`

### Showing higher resolution PDF distributions using precomputed data

`data(rayData)`

`pdfData <- aggregateData(rayData)`

`plotPDF(pdfData)`
`plotIntesities(pdfData)`
`plotMaxima(pdfData)`

### Show physics functions used

`plotFresnel()`
`plotRefractiveIndex()`

### Getting help

## rainbowLab Ray Tracing Model

The ray tracing model of rainbowLab is based on tracing a number of
rays through a water drop.
For this, number of light rays (`ray`) over a range of incident angles are generated by a
light source `arcLight` and traced through a `drop` defined by its
radius `R`, its origin `O` and its refractive index `ri`.
A ray entering the drop will be expanded into a number of
initially parallel rays differing in their assignedwavelength. The
wavelenght assignment is made by the `spectralize` function. 
Rays are traced through the drop based on a geomteric optics
model. Attenuation of the rays is modelled by `fresnel` coefficients.

### Visualising tracing of light rays
To visualise ray tracing through a water drop, use the function
`traceOneRay()` without any parameters. To alter the settings check
the documentation `?traceOneRay`. 

## Analysing the formation of rainbows

rainbowLab allows to analyse the formation of rainbows, notably
* The angeles under which rainbows of different orders can be observed
* The effects of dispersion related to different wavelengths
* The relative intensities of the rainbows of different orders
* The width of rainbows of different orders

### Data Types

#### rayData

`rayData` is a table (in `data.table` format) representing each ray
traced amongst others in terms of rainbow number (`rainbowNo`), wavelength in nm
(`lambda`), intensity (`I`) and angular deviation (difference between
incident and exting angle in degrees (`angDDeg`).
`rayData` is generated using `rayData <- generateRainbows()`

#### pdfData

`pdfData` is aggregated data over all rays traced. `pdfData` is
organized as tidy-data table (in `data.table` format) with the
categories `rainbowNo`, `lambda` and  angular bins `angD`. For each
category combination the intensity `I` is given. The intensity is
obtained by summing up all intensities per category from `rayData`
(using `pdfData <- aggregateData(rayData)`.


### Workflow

1. Generate rayData
2. Aggregate rayData to a probability density distribution/function
   (PDF)
3. Plot results

When using the highlevel function `generateRainbows()` all these steps
will be exectuted within the function call.
